## Required Baseline Verification
| Command | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make lint` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 1, 5, and final COMMAND ENTRY 9 |
| `make test` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 2, 6, and final COMMAND ENTRY 10 |
| `make release-check` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 3, 7, and final COMMAND ENTRY 11 + `release-check-summary.json` |
| `make ci-hardening-gate` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4, 8, and final COMMAND ENTRY 12 + `criteria-linkage-check.json` |

## DKT-046 Acceptance Mapping
| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Final packet includes required evidence artifacts | PASS | `report.md`, `verification.log`, `audit-summary.md`, release-check and linkage summaries |
| Criteria mapping shows complete coverage | PASS | `docs/reports/criteria-map.json`, `docs/reports/criteria-map.md` (all registry criteria mapped as `passed`) |
| Readiness summary is decision-ready and compatibility-safe | PASS | `docs/reports/final-run/v1.1-release-readiness-summary.md`, `audit-summary.md` |

## Guardrail Mapping
| Guardrail | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GR-COMP-001 (CLI names unchanged) | PASS | `make test` output in COMMAND ENTRY 2 (CI/CLI compatibility tests pass), `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-002 (`schema_version=1.0.0`) | PASS | `release-check-summary.json` (`schema_version=1.0.0`), `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-003 (`v1.0.0-rc1` anchors preserved) | PASS | no edits to `docs/reports/final-run/RELEASE_SNAPSHOT.md`, `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-004 (final-run topology stable) | PASS | evidence paths remain under `docs/reports/final-run/evidence/...` |
| GR-LGO-001 (LangGraph-only policy retained) | PASS | no rollout-policy weakening edits; criteria map + packet docs preserve policy references |
| GR-LGO-002 (legacy path absent as supported option) | PASS | no additions reintroducing legacy runtime support language |
| GR-LGO-003 (no parameterized engine switching guidance) | PASS | no CLI/runtime parameter guidance changes introduced |
| GR-EVID-001 (machine-parseable verification logs) | PASS | `verification.log` and `release-check-verification.log` include command-entry and `Command:` markers |

## Compatibility Notes
- DKT-046 is documentation/evidence focused; it introduces no runtime or CLI behavior changes.
- Evidence and readiness outputs remain additive and compatible with existing v1.0.0-rc1 anchors.
