- AC1 (After rotation orchestrator resumes correct step)
  Covered by: tests.reliability.test_handoff_package.CoreRotationHandoffTests.test_hooks_chain_pre_compact_then_session_start
- AC2 (Accepted steps are not re-executed by default)
  Covered by: tests.reliability.test_handoff_package.CoreRotationHandoffTests.test_rotation_resumes_correct_step_and_skips_accepted_by_default
- AC3 (Pending and failed steps remain resumable)
  Covered by: tests.reliability.test_handoff_package.CoreRotationHandoffTests.test_pending_and_failed_steps_remain_resumable
- Regression coverage for affected runtime surfaces
  Covered by: tests.hooks.test_runtime (all tests), tests.reliability.test_heartbeat_daemon, tests.reliability.test_lease_succession
