# DAOKit v1.3 Release Readiness Summary

## Decision
- Decision: **GO**
- Decision Basis Date: `2026-02-13`
- Basis Run: `DKT-063_20260213T125046Z_qv24vh6`

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage
1. Final packet includes required v1.3 evidence artifacts for P0 and P1 with traceable links: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/final-run/v1.3-final-verification-packet.md`, `docs/reports/dkt-063/evidence-linkage.json`
2. Readiness summary explicitly covers acceptance criteria and residual risks: **PASS**
   - Evidence: this document + `docs/reports/dkt-063/audit-summary.md`
3. Compatibility/runtime invariants remain intact and verified with command evidence: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/dkt-063/verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4-7, `docs/reports/dkt-063/release-check-summary.json`

## Decision Inputs
- Baseline verification chain passed:
  - `make lint`
  - `make test`
  - `make release-check`
- Criteria linkage check passed with zero issues:
  - `docs/reports/dkt-063/criteria-linkage-check.json`
- P0 scenario proof status:
  - real lane and fallback lane both end in `DONE`
  - process-path/artifact-structure/release-anchor checks all true
- P1 embedding decision status:
  - default backend in code: `local/token-signature`
  - DKT-061 metric-rule top backend: `local/token-signature`
  - selection-match check: true

## Compatibility Safety Check
- Public CLI parameter names: unchanged.
- `schema_version=1.0.0` semantics: unchanged.
- `v1.0.0-rc1` and `docs/reports/final-run/` anchors: preserved.
- Runtime policy remains LangGraph default; legacy runtime remains maintenance-only.

## Residual Risks
1. Baseline `make test` discovery still covers the default 26-test suite; non-default targeted suites require explicit invocation.
2. DKT-061 benchmark dataset (12 queries) is sufficient for v1.3 gating but may underrepresent long-tail retrieval intents.
3. P0 real-lane proof in this run uses a deterministic fake codex binary for auditable local verification; live external model behavior is not asserted by this step.

## Mitigations
1. Keep `make ci-hardening-gate` and targeted compatibility tests in CI/release sign-off.
2. Require benchmark refresh with expanded dataset before changing retrieval objective or default backend.
3. Preserve parser-compatible command evidence and criteria linkage checks for every release run.

## Go/No-Go Recommendation
- **GO for v1.3 final release readiness on this branch state.**
