# DAOKit v1.2 Release Readiness Summary

## Decision
- Decision: **GO**
- Decision Basis Date: `2026-02-13`
- Basis Run: `DKT-055_20260213T122000Z_ab12cde`

## Decision Inputs
- Baseline verification required by task prompt passed:
  - `make lint`
  - `make test`
  - `make release-check`
- Criteria diagnostics map remains at full coverage with explicit evidence pointers:
  - `docs/reports/criteria-map.json`
  - `docs/reports/criteria-map.md`

## Compatibility Safety Check
- Public CLI parameter names: unchanged.
- `schema_version=1.0.0` semantics: unchanged.
- `v1.0.0-rc1` and `docs/reports/final-run/` anchors: preserved.
- LangGraph-only policy: preserved; no parameterized engine-switch guidance introduced.

## Residual Risks
1. Evidence-pointer drift in future runs could degrade criteria linkage quality.
2. Future non-doc changes outside this task could affect compatibility guardrails.

## Mitigations
1. Keep `make ci-hardening-gate` in release validation and CI workflows.
2. Require parser-compatible command logs (`Command:` and `COMMAND ENTRY`) for every release verification run.
3. Keep criteria-map updates tied to concrete evidence artifacts before release sign-off.

## Go/No-Go Recommendation
- **GO for v1.2 final reliability packaging** on this branch state.
