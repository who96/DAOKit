# DAOKit v1.4 Release Readiness Summary

## Decision
- Decision: **GO**
- Decision Basis Date: `2026-02-13`
- Basis Run: `DKT-071_20260213T163910Z_j8q4n2s`

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage
1. Final packet includes required v1.4 evidence artifacts for P2 and P3 with traceable links: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/final-run/v1.4-final-verification-packet.md`, `docs/reports/dkt-071/report.md`
2. Baseline verification passes with markerized evidence: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/dkt-071/verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 1-3
3. Compatibility/runtime invariants remain intact and verified with command evidence: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/dkt-071/verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4-6 + `docs/reports/dkt-071/release-check-summary.json`
4. P2/P3 acceptance evidence is auditable and cross-backend consistency is demonstrated: **PASS**
   - Evidence: `docs/reports/dkt-071/verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 12-15 + `docs/reports/dkt-070/consistency-report.md`

## Decision Inputs
- Baseline verification chain passed:
  - `make lint`
  - `make test`
  - `make release-check`
- P2 targeted verification passed:
  - conditional-edge routing + auditable route diagnostics (`tests/orchestrator/test_langgraph_runtime.py`)
  - checkpoint recovery scenario included in cross-backend suite (`checkpoint_recovery`)
- P3 targeted verification passed:
  - `StateBackend` protocol + parity tests
  - SQLite atomicity and restart persistence tests
  - cross-backend consistency report PASS on recovery-relevant scenarios

## Compatibility Safety Check
- Public CLI parameter names: unchanged.
- `schema_version=1.0.0` semantics: unchanged.
- `v1.0.0-rc1` and `docs/reports/final-run/` anchors: preserved.
- Runtime policy remains LangGraph default; legacy runtime remains maintenance-only.

## Residual Risks
1. Default `make test` suite remains intentionally small; release evidence relies on explicit invocation of P2/P3 suites in `docs/reports/dkt-071/verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 12-15.
2. SQLite backend parity is validated for contract-relevant fields and atomicity, but long-running concurrency and high-volume event-append patterns would benefit from additional soak coverage.
3. Cross-backend consistency equivalence uses a volatile-field tolerance; differences outside the canonical contract snapshot are intentionally excluded and must be reviewed if the contract expands.

## Mitigations
1. Promote P2/P3 suites (or at least a subset) into `ci-hardening-gate` when moving from wave verification to `v1.4.0` tag finalization.
2. Extend reliability soak coverage for SQLite backend under representative workload sizes prior to expanding supported deployment modes.
3. Keep contract snapshots and ignored-field list under strict change control; treat snapshot expansion as a compatibility change requiring new evidence.

## Go/No-Go Recommendation
- **GO for v1.4 final release readiness on this branch state.**
