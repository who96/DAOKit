## Required Baseline Verification
| Command | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make lint` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 1 |
| `make test` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 2 |
| `make release-check` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 3 + `release-check-summary.json` |

## Compatibility/Invariant Verification
| Invariant | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI public names/args unchanged | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4 (`tests/cli/test_parser_compatibility.py`) |
| `schema_version=1.0.0` semantics intact | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4 + `release-check-summary.json` |
| `v1.0.0-rc1` anchor preserved | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 6 (`git rev-parse --verify v1.0.0-rc1`) |
| `docs/reports/final-run/` topology intact | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 4 + COMMAND ENTRY 6 |
| LangGraph default + legacy maintenance-only policy retained | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 5 |

## P2 Evidence (Conditional Edges + Checkpoint/Resume)
| Requirement | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-LG-001/002/003 conditional routing, deterministic diagnostics, illegal transitions fail explicitly | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 12 (`tests/orchestrator/test_langgraph_runtime.py -v`) |
| FR-CKPT-001/002/003 checkpoint persistence + resume without manual state repair | PASS | `docs/reports/dkt-070/consistency-report.md` (`checkpoint_recovery` PASS) + `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 15 |

## P3 Evidence (StateBackend + SQLite Parity + Consistency)
| Requirement | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-SB-001..004 `StateBackend` abstraction, FS retained, SQLite parity, backend selection remains internal | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 13-14 (`tests/state/* -v`) + COMMAND ENTRY 4 (CLI unchanged) |
| FR-CONS-001..003 cross-backend equivalence (incl recovery-relevant paths) | PASS | `docs/reports/dkt-070/consistency-report.json` + `docs/reports/dkt-070/verification.log` + `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 15 |

## Conclusion
- DKT-071 acceptance criteria status: `PASS`.
- v1.4 final verification packet is complete with traceable P2/P3 evidence and compatibility invariants explicitly verified.
