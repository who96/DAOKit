- Release-check log copy: `docs/reports/dkt-055/release-check-verification.log`
- Criteria map (final): `docs/reports/criteria-map.json`, `docs/reports/criteria-map.md`

## Required Baseline Verification
| Command | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make lint` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 1 |
| `make test` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 2 |
| `make release-check` | PASS | `verification.log` COMMAND ENTRY 3 + `release-check-summary.json` |

## DKT-055 Acceptance Mapping
| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Final packet includes required evidence artifacts | PASS | `report.md`, `verification.log`, `audit-summary.md`, release-check summary and log |
| Readiness summary is decision-ready and compatibility-safe | PASS | `docs/reports/final-run/v1.2-release-readiness-summary.md`, `audit-summary.md` |

## Guardrail Mapping
| Guardrail | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GR-COMP-001 (CLI names unchanged) | PASS | `make test` output in COMMAND ENTRY 2 (CLI compatibility tests pass), `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-002 (`schema_version=1.0.0`) | PASS | `release-check-summary.json` (`schema_version=1.0.0`), `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-003 (release anchors preserved) | PASS | no edits to `docs/reports/final-run/RELEASE_SNAPSHOT.md`, `audit-summary.md` |
| GR-COMP-004 (final-run topology stable) | PASS | evidence paths remain under `docs/reports/` and `docs/reports/final-run/` |
| GR-LGO-001 (LangGraph-only policy retained) | PASS | criteria map + packet docs preserve policy references |
| GR-EVID-001 (machine-parseable verification logs) | PASS | `verification.log` and release-check log include `Command:` and `COMMAND ENTRY` markers |

## Compatibility Notes
- This step is documentation/evidence only; no runtime or CLI behavior changes.
- Evidence and readiness outputs remain additive and compatible with existing `v1.0.0-rc1` anchors.
